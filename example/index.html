<h1>phpchart</h1>
<h2>
	Minimal SVG charts generated on the server, without the need for JavaScript
</h2>

<p>
	phpchart has three core objectives: speed, simplicity and portability.
</p>
<p>
	Rather than concentrating on animations and interactivity, phpchart renders on the server, which means there is no JavaScript required to build beautiful, functional charts.
</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;?php
$chart = new Chart();
$chart->type = Chart::TYPE_BAR;
$chart->title = "Browser market share (January 2015)";
$chart->subtitle = "Source Wikipedia";
$chart->series = [
	new Series(
		// TODO: Define syntax
	]);
];
$chart->render("#container");
</code></pre>
